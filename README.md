self_organizing_flock_experiment
================================

Processing experiment developed for the Festum 2 of autorganization at the Foundation Berrocal berrocal.net the 30th of August 2014


this is a flocking experiment built on 2014.08.30 for the berrocal.net festum of self-organization
Code by Beltran Berrocal and Jos√© M Bernal
other team members: Juanjo Valderrama and Antonio Matas
this flocking algorithm is a modified version of the Flocking example by Daniel Shiffman
http://processing.org/examples/flocking.html 

The aim is to gather data on the behavior of flocking birds who will have to escape a preador
in order to see how fast the decision is propagated in a group 
and where's the critical point of phase transition in the decision making process.
The data is exported to a txt in the same folder of the running code after "maxCycles",
to be later analyzed by an R script by Antonio Matas. 

Some data can be found in the Flock_Data folder
where each file has eppended the number of birds in the flock being considered.
For now the data is gathered only once the bird is withing the influeceRadius of the predator.
